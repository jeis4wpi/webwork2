"set in the main HTML tag set for the entire course based on the course "
"language.</p><p>There are two options for the DIRection attribute: \"ltr\" "

"and Hebrew.</p><p>The DIRection attribute is needed to trigger proper "
"display of the question text when the problem text-direction is different "
"than that used by the current language of the course. For example, English "
"problems from the library browser would display improperly in RTL mode for a "
"Hebrew course, unless the problen Direction is set to LTR.</p><p>The feature "
"to set a problem language and direction was only added in 2018 to the PG "
"language, so most problems will not declare their language, and the system "
"needs to fall back to determining the language and direction in a different "
"manner. The OPL itself is all English, so the system wide fallback is to en-"
"US in LTR mode.</p><p>Since the defaults fall back to the LTR direction, "

"the one which matches their course language. The mode \"force::ltr\" would "
"also be an option for a course which runs into trouble with the \"auto\" "
"modes.</p><p>Modes:</p><ul><li>\"none\" prevents any additional LANG and/or "
"DIR tag being added. The browser will use the main setting which was applied "
"to the entire HTML page. This is likely to cause trouble when a problem of "
"the other direction is displayed.</li><li>\"auto::\" allows the system to "
"make the settings based on the language and direction reported by the "
"problem (a new feature, so not set in almost all existing problems) and "
"falling back to the expected default of en-US in LTR mode. </li><li>\"auto:"
"LangCode:Dir\" allows the system to make the settings based on the language "
"and direction reported by the problem (a new feature, so not set in almost "
"all existing problems) but falling back to the language with the given "
"LangCode and the direction Dir when problem settings are not available from "
"PG.</li><li>\"auto::Dir\" for problems without PG settings, this will use "
"the default en=english language, but force the direction to Dir. Problems "
"with PG settings will get those settings.</li><li>\"auto:LangCode:\" for "
"problems without PG settings, this will use the default LTR direction, but "
"will set the language to LangCode.Problems with PG settings will get those "
"settings.</li><li>\"force:LangCode:Dir\" will <b>ignore</b> any setting made "
