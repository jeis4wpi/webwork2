"on the language and direction reported by the problem (a new feature, so not"
" set in almost all existing problems) and falling back to the expected "
"default of en-US in LTR mode. </li><li>\"auto:LangCode:Dir\" allows the "
"system to make the settings based on the language and direction reported by "
"the problem (a new feature, so not set in almost all existing problems) but "
"falling back to the language with the given LangCode and the direction Dir "
"when problem settings are not available from PG.</li><li>\"auto::Dir\" for "
"problems without PG settings, this will use the default en=english language,"
" but force the direction to Dir. Problems with PG settings will get those "
"settings.</li><li>\"auto:LangCode:\" for problems without PG settings, this "
